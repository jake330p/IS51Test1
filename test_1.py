The program is trying to determine which payment option is better (more money)
First option is $100 per day for 10 days. The second option is $1 a day with 
it being doubled each day for 10 days. There will be two functions to calculate the pay rate. 
function1 will calculate the amount for the first option, function2 will calculate the amount for the second option

function1 will output 100 * 10 days
function2 will loop 10 times, with each time doubling the amount and add the amoun to the total. 

if the amount is equal, we output to the use " Option 1 and option 2 are the same"
if the option1 is better, we output to the user "Option 1 is better"
if the option2 is better, we output to the user "Option 2 is better"
